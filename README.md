# Elixir Cluster on Hop

Using [libcluster](https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster) with the [libcluster_hop](https://github.com/hiett/libcluster_hop) strategy, you can easily create a clustered Elixir application on Hop. All nodes (containers) will be connected to each other.

This repo contains an example application which utilizes `libcluster_hop`.

## Run this on Hop

Follow the [Elixir Cluster](https://docs.hop.io/getting-started/quickstarts/elixir-cluster) quickstart guide.

## Demo

You can find this app running here: https://libcluster-hop.hop.sh  
Refresh to see the load balancing in action.

> Special thanks to community member [Scott Hiett](https://github.com/hiett) for creating the libcluster_hop strategy.
